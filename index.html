		<h1>Need a website?</h1>
		<p>
			I offer my skills to design and code a website for you.
		</p>
		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>
			First, we will set up a plan, specifying your requirements. You can be as precise as or as vague as you want. Perhaps you have a general theme, such as a comic-book themed site. Or maybe you have a layout and font you want to use. This will be documented in a plan, which we will both sign. The purpose of this is to prevent arguments later on with difficult clients. You can't ask me to spend six weeks making a website for you and say "well, I don't like it" or "I didn't agree to that" at the end.
			<br><br>
			Over the course of the site's development, I will send you regular screenshots of what the website is looking like thus far.
		</p>
		<h2>Cost</h2>
		<p>
			The overall price comes in two parts:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Payment to me to build the site</li>
			<li>Payment to a hosting company to host the site</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Part [1] will be paid one time to me directly at the end. I do not charge by the hour. The actual amount will vary depending on the complexity of the site. If your site only displays information about your business (such as an address, about section, contact information), the cost will probably be around 200-250 canadian dollars. If you want me to recreate facebook, expect it to cost likely 2000 canadian dollars or more.
			<br><br>
			Part [2] is hosting the site. This means taking the code I've written and posting it on the internet, so that the public can see your website. There are various services that offer web hosting; I can recommend one (since some are more safe than others) but you are free to choose a different one if you want??? (terms and conditions!) However, this part <strong>is not handled by me.</strong> It is handled by whichever hosting service is hosting the site. So if the site is down for some reason, you should contact them, as they are the ones keeping it on the internet.
			<br><br>
			And speaking of which, keeping it on the internet does cost money. This will likely be a regular monthly or yearly fee. The actual price will vary depending on which hosting service and what <strong>domain name</strong> you choose.
			<!-- <h3>What's a domain name</h3> -->
			The domain name is the address of the site (youtube.com, mysterio1000.github.io, etc.). A domain that is very general (e.g. oatmeal.com [bluebird.com]) and ends in <strong>.com</strong> will cost more money than a domain that is more obscure (e.g. xandar77.info). A more general domain is also more likely to be taken by someone else.
